"Small changes and small steps can create massive impact"

**Purpose**- Our purpose as an organization is to support and protect the health, mental well being and healing of black mothers

My birth story- In 2011 I welcomed my first daughter at 32 weeks. As a young mother I was frightened and never received any answers from my physicians. In 2012 I found out I was expecting a second child. This time I was even more nervous based on my first delivery. At 30 weeks I started to have contractions and was admitted to the hospital for 8 weeks on mandatory bed rest. My second daughter was delivered at 38 weeks again with no real explanation from any physicians. In 2022 I was again blessed to be expecting my third child. This time around I did more research and came prepared for my first visit with my provider. I asked at each of my visits for a cervical stitch also known as a cerclage. Despite all my efforts to be my own advocate I was met with being dismissed, given no answers or support from my medical team. I was told I was not a candidate for a cerclage since I had never lost a child (despite my preterm deliveries) and instead was told to take Makena; a medication I had taken with my second pregnancy and is currently under review to be pulled by the FDA for being ineffective. At 20 weeks during my anatomy scan I was met with the scariest news; my cervix was opened and I was immediately sent to labor and delivery for monitoring. After several hours of monitoring it was determined that I wasn't in active labor. Only at this time was a cerclage offered and it came with extreme risks based on how far along I was. As an alternative I was given at home bed rest and medication after the hospital staff refused to keep me. Over the next week I went to the emergency room on 3 different occasions; each time being sent away and again dismissed. On May 29, 2022 I again visited the emergency room with the same symptoms and this time my heart broke. My son's amniotic sac had bulged through my open cervix and there was nothing available to save him. On May 30, 2022 at 9:46 am I gave birth to my son Jamel meaning Beautiful in Arabic. My absolute final straw was at my follow up, receiving "reassurance" from my physician saying now I was a perfect candidate for a cerclage and they would "know now" if I wanted to get pregnant again. This was the ultimate slap in the face for this medical team to think that I would trust them with my care ever again. Why did they not care to help me at every plea I made leading up to this tragic loss. From there on I would do everything in my power to get justice for my son and ensure that no other mother is treated in this way again. 

**Mission**- Our mission is to support policy change and legislation, engage in advocacy and improve care solutions to bring equity to expecting black mothers and their babies.
